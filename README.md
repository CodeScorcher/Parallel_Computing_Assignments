# Parallel_Computing_Assignments

This set of source code goes over the foundations and practical knowledge about parallel computing. Students 
will be learning popular parallel computing tools using the C language. In addition, I applied the following:
* 1) Understand the basic parallel hardware and the parallel software design methodology.
* 2) Implement efficient parallel programs for various sample problems.
* 3) Be very familiar with using Message-Passing Interface (MPI), POSIX Threads (Pthreads), and OpenMP - three of the most widely used APIs for parallel programming to write parallel programs.
