# Concurrent and Distributed Programming

This set of source code goes over the foundations and practical knowledge about parallel computing. Each assignment solution involved the use of popular parallel computing tools that utilize the C language. In addition, I applied the following:
* Understand the basic parallel hardware and the parallel software design methodology.
* Implement efficient parallel programs for various sample problems.
* Be very familiar with using Message-Passing Interface (MPI), POSIX Threads (Pthreads), and OpenMP - three of the most widely used APIs for parallel programming to write parallel programs.
